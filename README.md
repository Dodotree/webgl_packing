# WebGL Binary Image Packing

This repository demonstrates an efficient technique for processing binary (black and white) image data using WebGL. The core concept is packing 32 binary pixels into a single RGBA pixel, where each channel (R, G, B, A) stores 8 binary values as bits. This approach optimizes memory usage and processing speed by utilizing the full capacity of each pixel in GPU memory, allowing for 32× data compression and potentially significant performance improvements when working with large binary image datasets.

The implementation uses WebGL 2.0 and GLSL shaders to perform both the packing and unpacking operations. During the packing phase, the fragment shader analyzes 8×4 blocks of binary pixels from the source image and encodes their values into bit patterns stored in RGBA channels. For unpacking, a separate shader decodes these values back into their original binary representation. Between these operations, the packed representation enables efficient binary operations (like AND, OR, XOR) directly in the shader, making complex pattern recognition or binary morphology operations much faster than traditional pixel-by-pixel processing.

This technique bridges the gap between binary image processing algorithms and GPU acceleration, providing significant benefits for applications like OCR, barcode/QR code scanning, document processing, and medical image analysis. These optimizations can be deployed across virtually any modern device without requiring specialized hardware or software installations.
